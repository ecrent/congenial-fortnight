Areas to Consider
Database Connection Management:

Consider reviewing the database connection pooling setup
Verify error handling for database connection failures
Logging Strategy:

Current logging appears developer-focused
Production might benefit from structured logging and log levels
Environment Variables:

Ensure all required environment variables are documented
Verify fallback values where appropriate
Security Headers:

Consider adding security headers (helmet.js)
Review Content-Security-Policy needs
Documentation:

API documentation for consumers
Deployment procedures documentation
Monitoring & Metrics:

No clear monitoring solution visible in the code
Consider health check endpoints
Deployment Configuration:

Review startup procedures
Consider graceful shutdown handling
