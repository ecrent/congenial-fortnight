## Your Current Roadmap
1. Server tests (E2E)
2. UI improvements (more elegant design)
3. Unit and integrity tests
4. AWS deployment (new domain + email)
5. Email functionality (welcome user, forgot password)
6. User testing
7. Finalization

### Before Deployment:
- **Security Audit**: Implement authentication token storage best practices, SQL injection protection, and XSS prevention
- **Performance Optimization**: Especially important for the scheduling algorithm with larger datasets
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works well on mobile devices
- **Accessibility Testing**: Implement WCAG guidelines for better accessibility

## UI Improvement Ideas
For the UI enhancement, consider:

1. A modern color scheme with accent colors
2. Custom illustrations for empty states
4. Card-based design with consistent shadows and spacing
5. Background patterns or gradients instead of plain white
