## Your Current Roadmap
1. Server tests (E2E)
2. UI improvements (more elegant design)
3. Unit and integrity tests
4. AWS deployment (new domain + email)
5. Email functionality (welcome user, forgot password)
6. User testing
7. Finalization

### Before Deployment:
- **Security Audit**: Implement authentication token storage best practices, SQL injection protection, and XSS prevention
- **Performance Optimization**: Especially important for the scheduling algorithm with larger datasets
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works well on mobile devices
- **Accessibility Testing**: Implement WCAG guidelines for better accessibility

## UI Improvement Ideas
For the UI enhancement, consider:

1. A modern color scheme with accent colors
2. Custom illustrations for empty states
4. Card-based design with consistent shadows and spacing
5. Background patterns or gradients instead of plain white


# Security Enhancement Plan for Meeting Time Finder

After reviewing your application, here are three comprehensive security measures that would protect your database information and optimize server-side resource usage:

## 1. Implement API Rate Limiting and Request Throttling

**Why it's important:**
- Prevents brute force attacks on login endpoints
- Protects server resources from excessive CPU/memory usage
- Mitigates potential DoS (Denial of Service) attacks

**Implementation plan:**
- Add rate limiting middleware to Express routes, particularly authentication endpoints
- Set reasonable limits based on endpoint purpose (stricter for authentication, more lenient for normal operations)
- Use IP-based and user-based rate limiting for different scenarios
- Implement progressive delays for repeated failed authentication attempts
- Add monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns

## 2. Enhanced Authentication with JWT and Secure Session Management

**Why it's important:**
- Your current system uses basic username/password authentication
- Lacks proper session management and token validation
- Vulnerable to session hijacking and CSRF attacks

**Implementation plan:**
- Replace current authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) system
- Implement token expiration and refresh token rotation
- Store only token hashes in the database, never raw tokens
- Add CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Implement secure HTTP headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection)
- Use HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags for session cookies

## 3. Database Security Hardening

**Why it's important:**
- Protects against SQL injection (though you're using parameterized queries, which is good)
- Prevents unauthorized data access and data leakage
- Ensures proper resource management and prevents server overload

**Implementation plan:**
- Implement database connection pooling with proper timeout and resource limits
- Use least-privilege database users for different operations (read-only vs. write access)
- Add database query timeout limits to prevent long-running queries
- Implement data validation/sanitization before database operations
- Consider column-level encryption for sensitive data like email addresses
- Set up database activity monitoring to detect unusual query patterns
- Regularly audit and optimize database queries to reduce server load

Each of these measures addresses both your concerns about database information protection and server CPU usage, creating a more robust and secure application while ensuring optimal performance.
