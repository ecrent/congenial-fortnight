# Scheduler Application Development Log

## Initial Setup and Requirements

Today we began developing a scheduler application that helps groups find optimal meeting times. The core concept is simple:

1. A user creates a scheduling session and gets a unique code
2. They share this code with their group
3. Each member joins with the code, registers with their name
4. Everyone inputs their availability 
5. After marking themselves as "ready"
6. The system calculates and displays optimal meeting times for the group

## Project Structure

We built the application with:
- **Frontend**: React with React Router, Context API for state management
- **Backend**: Express.js with PostgreSQL database
- **Communication**: RESTful API endpoints

## Development Process

### 1. Backend Foundation
- Set up Express server with routes for sessions, users, schedules
- Created PostgreSQL schema for storing session, user, and availability data
- Implemented endpoints for creating/joining sessions
- Added user registration within sessions
- Built availability input functionality
- Created algorithm for finding optimal meeting times

### 2. Frontend Core Components
- Built SessionContext to manage state and authentication
- Created registration flow for users to join sessions
- Implemented availability input interface
- Added "ready" functionality to trigger result calculation
- Built results display with filtering by duration

### 3. Error Handling and Flow Improvements
- Added error handling throughout application
- Implemented redirects for invalid paths or missing prerequisites
- Created polling mechanism to check when all users are ready
- Added ability to go back and modify availability if needed

## Key Components We Built

### Backend Components
- **Session Management**: Generate unique codes, track expirations
- **User Registration**: Associate users with sessions
- **Schedule Input**: Store and retrieve user availability
- **Optimal Time Calculation**: Find overlapping free times for all users

### Frontend Components
- **Home**: Landing page with clear call-to-action
- **SessionJoin**: Create new sessions or join existing ones
- **UserRegistration**: Simple name input for participants
- **ScheduleInput**: Add/remove availability slots, mark as ready
- **Results**: Display optimal meeting times with filtering

## Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Session Management**: Created unique codes and proper expiration handling
2. **User Synchronization**: Made sure all users see updates as others mark themselves ready
3. **Overlapping Time Calculation**: Built algorithm to find times when everyone is available
4. **State Management**: Used React Context API to maintain session state across components
5. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application

## Design Principles Applied

- **Simplicity**: Kept the interface clean and straightforward
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Only showed relevant information at each step
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling for user status changes
- **Feedback**: Clear indicators when actions are successful or fail
- **Reversibility**: Allow users to go back and modify their inputs

## Next Steps

The application now has a solid foundation with all the core functionality implemented. Potential future enhancements could include:

- Calendar view for more visual availability input
- Email notifications for session participants
- User authentication for more secure sessions
- Mobile-responsive design optimizations
- Persistent storage of meeting results

## Conclusion

We successfully built a functional scheduler application that allows groups to easily find optimal meeting times. The application follows a clean, step-by-step flow that guides users through the process from session creation to viewing results, all while maintaining a simple and intuitive interface.
