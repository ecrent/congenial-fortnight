# Committing and Pushing Changes in GitHub Codespaces

When you encounter a "Permission denied" error while pushing, it usually means your HTTPS authentication isn't using valid credentials (i.e. a Personal Access Token).

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Ensure Your Repository is Initialized:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
2. **Set or Update Your Remote URL with Your Personal Access Token (PAT):**
   - Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOURPAT` with your token.
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://USERNAME:YOURPAT@github.com/ecrent/seproject.git
   ```
3. **Alternatively, Use the Codespaces "Publish Branch" Option:**
   - The Codespaces UI provides a "Publish Branch" button that automatically handles authentication.
   
4. **Push Your Changes:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Follow these steps in your Codespaces terminal and you should be able to push without the permission error.
